# interpret

Interpret English into Hobbsian logical forms.

Dependencies for the server are handled by Docker. The client depends on
the 'click' package: `conda install click` or `pip3 install click`.

Build and run the image:
```
./build
./run
```

Send requests using the example client:
```
./client I interrogated him.
./client -s sentence.txt
./client -p sentence_parse_lf.txt
```

Send requests as JSON:
```
curl -d '{"s": "I interrogated him."}' http://localhost:5000/interpret
```

Interpret uses the knowledge base in kb/kb.lisp, which is copied into the
Docker image when it is built. A different KB can be sent with a
particular request:
```
./client -s sentence.txt -k kb/custom.kb
```
